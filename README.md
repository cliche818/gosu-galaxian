## Project for the speed sprint workshop [first presented at Toronto Ruby Hack Night, January 28, 2016]

This project, based on the RubyManor project by Bel√©n Albeza, has been selected to be a part of the speed-sprint workshop.
The speed-sprint project can be found here: https://github.com/k00ka/speed-sprint.

# User Stories
1. block pattern of enemies + levels + scoring

  The enemies are too disorderly. Make the enemies move as a large group (think *Galaxian* or *Space Invaders*). After you kill this block, a new block should appear. The user should also get a scoring bonus with each block cleared.

2. diving two at a time

  The user should see 2 enemies dive off from the main block and fall to the bottom of the window. The user should die if he collides with a falling enemy. Enemies that fall off screen should return to their block.

3. sound (shots, collisions, movement, diving)

  We need some SFX to jazz this game up! Use some fun sounds for various game events.

4. increased speed and frequency of diving

  The game needs to get more challenging. More diving enemies, more frequently, more more more! Maybe diving enemies could drop some bombs as they fall as well.
